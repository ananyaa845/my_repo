    <h1 style="color: rgb(161, 98, 21);">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara</h1>
    <p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(15, 15, 34); width:500px;font-size: large;">Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara is a Hindi film directed by Zoya Akhtar, released in 2011. It's a beautiful story about friendship, love, adventure, and living life to the fullest.
         The movie captures the spirit of youth and the importance of making the most of every moment.</p>
    <p class="one">The story follows three friends — Kabir, Arjun, and Imran — who go on a road trip in Spain as a bachelor party before Kabir's wedding. 
        Along the way, they take part in exciting activities like deep-sea diving, skydiving, and the famous bull run,
         each helping them overcome fears and discover more about themselves.</p>
    <p class="two">I like Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara because it feels real and relatable. 
        It shows how important it is to take a break, think about what really matters, and spend time with the people you care about. 
        The movie's calm pace, meaningful conversations, and beautiful locations make it something I can watch again whenever.</p>
